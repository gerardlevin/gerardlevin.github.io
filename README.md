This was a sample program created after taking the front end web development course at General Assembly.  

Using data on ski resorts across the world, the user selects...
  -both the characteristics of ski resorts they are interested in
  -and the degree to which that characteristic matters to them
  
In return, the code will reorder the list of ski resorts so that the 'best match' is at the top of the list
